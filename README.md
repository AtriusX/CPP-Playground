# CPP Playground

This project is a testing ground for my experiments with C++.

Any experiments I choose to come up with will likely be contributed here as a way to slowly build out my familiarity with the syntax and behavior of the language. The code presented here
will likely serve no practical purpose except to demonstrate how things function, as well as my current understanding of things.
